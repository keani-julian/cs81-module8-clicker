# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Being able to select elements using `getElementById` and seeing the page update in real time made the connection between JS and the DOM intersting to tinker with.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I created messages that matched the click milestones and reflected a playful “galaxy” theme, including small encouragements and humor for engagement.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
Initially, the background color did not update because I was using `=` instead of `textContent` on the wrong element. Once I fixed the selection, updates worked as expected.

## What personal twist did you add?
I changed the theme to “Galaxy Cookie Clicker” and used background color changes at milestones to make it visually dynamic.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Many web games and interactive dashboards use click-based counters, such as online quizzes, incremental games, and social media reaction trackers.
